1. Create a `.env` file

2. Set the NODE_ENV variable in this file :

   ```
   NODE_ENV=local

   ```
4. Create a `.env.local` file\
   \*variables here are suggested to have a separated set for production

   ```

3. (Optional) zip the app into `app.zip` if needed :\
   `npm run zip`

4. Deploy to your chosen platform

## Troubleshoot

If you are not using AWS Beanstalk to deply the service, replace the `build` script in the `scripts` field in `package.json` as following:

```
"scripts": {
   ...,
   "build": "rm -rf dist && rm -rf app.zip && npm run build:all && cd dist && npm install --omit=dev ",
   ...
},
```
